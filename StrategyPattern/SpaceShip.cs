    //The idea behind the strategy pattern is to encapsulate behaviors(usually methods/functions) within a class that
    //are likely to change, together.

    //The strategy pattern revolves around the idea of 'programming to an interface'. This is referring to the general definition of an interface,
    //and not the C# interface. It is designing what your code does, as opposed to how it does it. This is because the how is likely to change
    //over time. It adds flexibility to your code by preventing the need to change code in multiple areas of your codebase to make just one
    //change to a class's behavior.

    //I'll go through each method and see if we can decide if they are likely to be modified in the future.
