        //notified and updated automatically. When the state of the 'subject' object changes, any object that is observing('observer') it will be notified and can then 
        //update, execute etc. These relationships are loosly coupled, or operate with little dependency on each other. This helps allow the object's continued use
        //with relative independence, and increases flexability.
