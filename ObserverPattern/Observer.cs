{

    //The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are
    //notified and updated automatically. When the state of the 'subject' object changes, any object that is observing('observer') it will be notified and can then 
    //update, execute etc. These relationships are loosly coupled, or operate with little dependency on each other. This helps allow the object's continued use
    //with relative independence, and increases flexability.

    //Let's see here, I can imagine a bunch of snow sports that depend on snow in various depths. I'm going to create a snowfall instrument class as the Subject
    //and various snow activities that are observers. Each one will have a boolean property that decides if you should do that sport. It will be dependent on the 
    //snowfall and update each time a new snowfall is reported.

    //I'll start by creating a subject and observer interface.
