        //notified and updated automatically. When the state of the 'subject' object changes, any object that is observing('observer') it will be notified and can then 
        //update, execute etc. These relationships are loosly coupled, or operate with little dependency on each other. This helps allow the object's continued use
        //with relative independence, and increases flexability.

        //Let's see here, I can imagine a bunch of snow sports that depend on snow in various depths. I'm going to create a snowfall instrument class as the Subject
        //and various snow activities that are observers. Each one will have a boolean property that decides if you should do that sport. It will be dependent on the
